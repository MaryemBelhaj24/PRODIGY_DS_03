## Decision Tree Classifier for Customer Purchase Prediction
## Overview
This project aims to build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. We’ll use the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Dataset
**Dataset Name:** Bank Marketing

**Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository

**Description:** The data is related to a Portuguese banking institution's direct marketing campaigns (phone calls). The goal is to predict if the client will subscribe to a term deposit.

**Features:** Demographic and behavioral attributes such as age, job type, marital status, education level, credit default status, balance, housing loan, personal loan, contact communication type, and more.

**Target Variable:** Binary outcome indicating whether the client subscribed to a term deposit.

## Approach
**Data Preprocessing:** Explore the dataset, handle missing values, encode categorical features, and split into training and testing sets.

**Decision Tree Model:** Train a decision tree classifier using the training data.

**Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model’s performance using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.

**Interpretability:** Visualize the decision tree to understand feature importance and decision rules.
